PiHeatingController
===================

As a parisian living in old building, I have to control the heater on my boiler.

The aim of this project is to control two servo motors that will turn the heater button and power button using a raspberry pi.
To control the servo motor I will use servoblaster : https://github.com/jronald/PiBits/tree/master/ServoBlaster
